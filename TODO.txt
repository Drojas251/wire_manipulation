# Grasp Orientation 

1.) Use the tanget vector computed from the bezier class to get the reference vector in the wiresim
    At the moment, we get the reference vector by finding the position vector from the nieghbor node
    This is not accurate. Incorporate the bezier class in some how to do This
2.) use cartesian controller to actually move the wire
